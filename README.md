# Unnamed-programmer

The programer to rule them all, the development of this programmer arised from the need of a unlimited, open-source, capable programmer.
Based on OpenOCD capabilities and the FT4232H USB-Multiprotocol IC.

Planned features:
- Circuit powering with ajustable voltage from 1.8V to 5V with up to 2A current capability, limited by the usb port power capability.
- Current measuring when circuit is powered by the programmer, to aid in the development of low power applications, current measurement down to uA.
- Support for JTAG, SWD and SPI programming, possibly more. this allows it to program most of mcu fmilies arround and also FPGA's
- Vsource measurement, when working with self powered applications, maybe other adc channels for generic use?.
- logic level converting allows interfacing with hardware from 1.8V to 5V.
- 2 SWO Ports Or Uarts for debbuging applications.
- No feature creeping (lol, i try), just what makes sense and is usefull for the programmer.

## Getting Started

```
TODO
```

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

```
TODO
```

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

```
TODO
```

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

```
TODO
```

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

```
TODO
```

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests
